# JavaScript PokeDex

This is a simple PokeDex web page using JavaScript and serves as an introduction to APIs. For this project i knew i wanted to to use an API and utilize it to make
a nice web page that displays API data.
Currently only the first generation pokemons are viewable but i'm planning to implement the other generations with additional features such as:

- Searching
- Filtering
- Detail panel
