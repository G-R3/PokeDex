# JavaScrip PokeDex 
This is a simple PokeDex web app using JavaScript and serves as an introduction to APIs. For this project i knew i wanted to to use an API and utilize it to make
a nice web page that displays API data.
Currently only the first generation pokemosn are viewable but i'm planning to implement the other generations with additional features such as:
  * Searching
  * Filtering
  * Detail panel
